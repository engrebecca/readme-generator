# README Generator

## Description
The README Generator allows developers to automatically create a README file through a few simple prompts in command line. It generates key information sections such as title, description, badges, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. It allows developers to create a quality README to use as is or to build off of. By spending less time creating a README, developers can focus their time on building more projects.

## Table of Contents
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Tests](#tests)
* [Questions](#questions)
